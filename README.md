## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
The management at Olive Hospital has noticed a significant increase in hospital readmissions, particularly among elderly patients. They aim to reduce readmission rates overall to make better use of available beds for new patients, utilize resources more efficiently, and improve patient satisfaction.

---

##  Problem Statement

- Olive Hospital has a significant increase in the readmission and wants to find out the readmission rate

- The hospital seeks to determine which age groups have the highest readmission rates.

- The hospital wants to identify factors contributing to increased readmissions.

---

## Data and Methodology

Dataset: The dataset contains patient information, including age groups, admission information, and readmission status.

Filtering: Focusing on the two age groups with the highest readmission rates

Correlation Analysis: Identifing the most positively correlated factors contributing to readmissions.

Visualization: Using heatmaps and correlation tables to interpret the findings.

---
## KPI's Trends
## Hospital Readmission Rate.

The hospital readmission rate is 47.02% (higher than the industry average of 30%)

## Finding out the top age groups with readmission rates.

Top 2 Age Groups with Highest Readmission Rates:
(70-80) 28.38%
(60-70) 23.56%

## Correlation Analysis

What are the key factors influencing the readmission in these age groups?

Inpatient visits (0.20 correlation) have the highest positive impact on readmission.  

Outpatient visits, emergency visits, lab procedures, and medications show very weak or no correlation.

## Recommendations

- Improve Inpatient Care Management: Since inpatient visits show the highest correlation with readmissions, enhancing post-discharge care and follow-up programs can help.

- Targeted Patient Education: Patients aged 60-80 should receive personalized discharge instructions to prevent complications.

- Enhanced Outpatient Monitoring: Strengthen outpatient support services to reduce the likelihood of hospital readmission.

- Medication Adherence Programs: Implement initiatives to ensure proper medication use among discharged patients.
